# Scotto34 (PCB Edition)

The Scotto34 (PCB Edition) is a low-profile 34-key split monoblock ortholinear keyboard that uses 18x17mm spaced Choc switches and an exposed controller in the middle.

You can read more about the components and how to build it [here](https://scottokeebs.com/blogs/keyboards/scotto34-pcb-keyboard).

_Since I release all my handwired boards for free I do not release any files for my PCB boards other than firmware. Please be aware that the only way to get a 3D printed case is by purchasing one through me, thank you for understanding._
